It's transforming an amazing on boarding animation concept (inspired from dribbble) to a flutter code and making it
reusable.

To use this animation, you can follow the instructions bellow : 

- Downloand the project (be sure to have the latest flutter framwork in your test system)
- In the home.dart you will find the Aniamtion widget iwth these params :
    * First widget : the first widget (page) of the on boarding which you will start with.
    * Second widget : the widget you want to move to using the animation after clicking the button of launching the animation
    * Button colors : which is just a list containing the colors of the button (before and after) in each case of the aniamtion status
