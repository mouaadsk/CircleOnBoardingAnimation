//! this file contains the parameters of the animation and any width or height depends on the screenHeight or the screenWidth 
//! for example we always do this : RealElementHeight/Width = elementWidth/tHeight * screenHeight/Width 
double buttonHeight = .1, buttonBottomMargin = 0.15;

//! the zoomFactor paramaeter means how much of growth the cutted rectangle (transformed to a circle) must be 
double circleZoomingFactor = 50;
